# dpoljak.github.io/micro.css

This is a temporary repository made for my own minimal CSS framework and it's showcase website.
It has been made for a-k-apart competition in making a website in under 10kilobytes.

The framework itself is 2 kilobytes and contains the bare minimum needed to get your site up and running as fast as possible
and not impacting the page load time like most modern frameworks.
